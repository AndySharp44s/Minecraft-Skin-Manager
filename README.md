# Minecraft Skin Manager
This program is designed for non-premium Minecraft users who need to change their skin or apply the same one every time they switch servers using the /skin command. This program allows you to store an unlimited number of skins, ready to use on any server for free. By clicking on a skin, it will automatically generate the command and copy it to your clipboard, making it as easy as pasting it.

## Features

- Compatibility with older skins.
> Old 64x32 skins will be automatically converted to the 64x64 version.
- Easily import and delete skins.
- View the skin from all angles.
- Save all skins in a single file to simplify pack sharing or enhance security in case of accidental deletion.
- Supports both wide and slim skins.
- Includes a player search feature where you can quickly save the skins of specific players.
- Detects when you copy a skin and can automatically save it for you, so you donâ€™t even need to bother downloading them.
- Has its own extension, .cskins; when opened, it imports all the skins it contains, allowing you to send as many as you like to your friends.

## Dependencies

The only thing required is obtaining an Imgur client ID (completely free and very simple). [Click here for a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu8zhInwn8A).
